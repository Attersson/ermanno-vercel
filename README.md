This [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project was bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app), for the GauntletAI Learning Paths, under instruction by Roger Hunt.

## Getting Started

Just run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

I edited the `app/page.tsx` page (which auto-updates as one edits and saves the file) and added a random counter widget for demo purposes..

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Last step of (easy) tutorial - Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy this Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js, using the [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying). This is the last step of this easy tutorial.
